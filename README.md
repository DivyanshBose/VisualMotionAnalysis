**Visual Motion Analysis Using Images and Videos**

**Project Overview**

This project focuses on estimating the poses and movements of players and athletes in various activities using computer vision techniques. We've developed a pose connection map to analyze key points and, based on these key points, detect the type of activity being performed.

**Key Features**
1. Pose estimation of human subjects during various activities.
2. Activity classification based on pose analysis.
3. Integration with OpenCV, Mediapipe, NumPy, and Matplotlib for comprehensive functionality.

**Getting Started**
**Prerequisites**

1. Python 3.x
2. OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library)
3. NumPy
4. Mediapipe
5. Matplotlib
